## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is the third project I did at 42 S√£o Paulo:
an implementation of the famous `printf` function from scratch.

It was a big project and my first milestone at 42:
I felt properly challenged and out of my comfort zone throughout most of it.
It taught me how to organize code effectively in C,
and to separate responsibilities without resorting to
Classes and Objects (which is what I'm used to).

I managed to do it without using a single `malloc` or `free`,
but with pointers to stack structs that I pass around to each handler.
There's an isolated struct, handler, and formatter for each conversion.

The only thing that conversion "modules" share are
the flags parser and the utility functions from libft.
I did it this way so I didn't need to worry about breaking the formatting
of other conversions as I tinkered with the rules.

This was a really good decision since there are many formatting exceptions
and flag combinations that vary from conversion to conversion,
and it sure saved me some headaches.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

All you need is a shell and a C compiler like `gcc` or `clang`.

### Installing

To compile the entire thing just clone the repo and run `make`:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/librity/ft_printf.git
$ cd ft_printf
$ make
```

This will generate a `libftprintf.a` archive, which you can compile with
any of the examples files:

```bash
$ cp examples/example_1.c example.c
$ gcc -g -I ./includes example.c libftprintf.a
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

You can call `ft_printf` as you would call your system's `printf` function:

```c
ft_printf("'%-10s'\n", "Hello, world!");
```

It handles most conversions:

- Percent char `%%`
- Unsigned char `%c`
- Signed decimal integer `%i` or `%d`
- Null-terminated string `%s`
- Unsigned decimal integer `%u`
- Uppercase unsigned hexadecimal `%X`
- Lowercase unsigned hexadecimal `%x`
- Pointer/ hexadecimal memory address `%p`

And also handles almost all the flags:

- Zero padding `0`
- Let-justified `-`
- Minimum field width
- Precision `.`
- Wildcard arguments `*`

Conversions and flags most respect the format:
`%[0 and/or -][width][.number]conversion`

Unfortunately there's no rigorous documentation or standard for this function,
and a lot of its behavior is implementation-specific.
There's many corner-cases that need to be ironed out by trial and error.
Since this is a 42 project, I copied the behavior of Apple's `printf`.

[This](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/)
is best source I could find on the project,
and should be enough to get you started.

Part of the larger [42 Network](https://www.42.fr/42-network/),
[42 S√£o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/) is a software engineering school
that offers a healthy alternative to traditional education:

- It doesn't have any teachers or classrooms.
- Students learn from and correct each other's work (peer-to-peer learning).
- The method develops technical and social skills.
- It's completely free to anyone that passes its selection process - **The Piscine**

It's an amazing project, and I'm enjoying every second of it.
